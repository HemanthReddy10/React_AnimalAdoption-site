He said these reflexes are hard-wired into dogs. He coined the cat's food as an unconditioned stimulus and the salivation as an unconditioned response - this response did not require any learning on the dog's part.\n\n                    </div>\n                    <button\n        className=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => {\n          setModalOpen(true);\n        }}\n      >\n        <span>Adopt</span>\n      </button>\n      \n                   \n      {modalOpen && <Modal setOpenModal={setModalOpen} callBack={callBack} />}  \n                \n                   \n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"cards1\">\n\n                    <img src=\"http://placekitten.com/183/250?image=5\"alt=\"Not Found ash\" className=\"CardLogo1\" width=\"183\" height=\"250\"/>\n                    \n                    <h3 className=\"card_heading1\">Tuska</h3>\n    \n                    \n                    <div className=\"cardText1\">\n                        Cats’ lives are too short. Their only fault, really. I love my pet cat, and I know many other people feel the same way about their pets. cats make great companions, and they provide us with a lot of love and affection. In this paragraph, I want to talk about some of the things that I enjoy doing with my pet dog.\n                        One of my favourite activities is taking my cat for walks. It’s a great way to get some exercise, and it’s also a lot of fun. I love seeing all the different sights and sounds in my neighbourhood, and my cat loves to explore everything he can find. We always have a great time when we go for walks together.\n                        Pavlov had the idea that dogs do not need to learn certain things, such as salivating when they see food. He said these reflexes are hard-wired into dogs. He coined the dog's food as an unconditioned stimulus and the salivation as an unconditioned response - this response did not require any learning on the dog's part.\n\n                    </div>\n                    <button\n        className=\"button\"\n        onClick={() => {\n          setModalOpen(true);\n        }}\n      >\n        <span>Adopt</span>\n      </button>\n      \n                   \n      {modalOpen && <Modal setOpenModal={setModalOpen} callBack={callBack} />}  \n                \n                   \n                </div>\n             \n          \n\n       \n            </div>\n\n        </main>\n      \n\n\n    \n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,IAAEC,QAAQ,QAAO,OAAO;AACpC,OAAO,sBAAsB;AAC7B,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,iDAAiD;AACpE,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,uCAAuC;AACvD,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,SAAS;AAAC;AAE5B,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAG,QAAgB;EAAA;EAAA,IAAf;IAACC;EAAQ,CAAC;EACrB,MAAM,CAACC,SAAS,EAAEC,YAAY,CAAC,GAAGP,QAAQ,CAAC,KAAK,CAAC;EAKnD,oBAEE;IAAM,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;IAAA,wBACd;MAAI,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;MAAC,EAAE,EAAC,SAAS;MAAA;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAA8D,eACtG;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;MAAA,wBAExB;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAA,wBAGf;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEC,MAAO;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC,kBAAkB;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAC,KAAK,EAAC,KAAK;UAAC,MAAM,EAAC;QAAK;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAK7F;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAa,eAI1C;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAKf,eAIzB;UACE,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAClB,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;YACbM,YAAY,CAAC,IAAI,CAAC;UACpB,CAAE;UAAA,uBAEF;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAkB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX,EAGRD,SAAS,iBAAI,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,YAAY,EAAEC,YAAa;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAEF;QAAS;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QACvD,eAEN;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAA,wBAEnB;UAAK,GAAG,EAAEH,GAAI;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC,eAAe;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAC,KAAK,EAAC,KAAK;UAAC,MAAM,EAAC;QAAK;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAEnF;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAW,eAGxC;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAKpB,eACN;UACZ,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAClB,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;YACbK,YAAY,CAAC,IAAI,CAAC;UACpB,CAAE;UAAA,uBAEF;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAkB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX,EAGRD,SAAS,iBAAI,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,YAAY,EAAEC,YAAa;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAEF;QAAS;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAGvD,eAEN;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAA,wBAEnB;UAAK,GAAG,EAAC,wCAAwC;UAAC,GAAG,EAAC,eAAe;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAC,KAAK,EAAC,KAAK;UAAC,MAAM,EAAC;QAAK;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAEtH;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAU,eAGvC;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAKpB,eACN;UACZ,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAClB,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;YACbE,YAAY,CAAC,IAAI,CAAC;UACpB,CAAE;UAAA,uBAEF;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAkB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX,EAGRD,SAAS,iBAAI,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,YAAY,EAAEC,YAAa;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAEF;QAAS;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAGvD,eAEN;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAA,wBAEnB;UAAK,GAAG,EAAC,wCAAwC;UAAA,GAAG,EAAC,eAAe;UAAC,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAC,KAAK,EAAC,KAAK;UAAC,MAAM,EAAC;QAAK;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAE,eAErH;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAW,eAGxC;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAKpB,eACN;UACZ,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAClB,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;YACbE,YAAY,CAAC,IAAI,CAAC;UACpB,CAAE;UAAA,uBAEF;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QAAkB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QACX,EAGRD,SAAS,iBAAI,QAAC,KAAK;UAAC,YAAY,EAAEC,YAAa;UAAC,QAAQ,EAAEF;QAAS;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAAG;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAGvD;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA,QAKJ;EAAA;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QAEH;AAMf,CAAC;AAAC,GA7IID,KAAK;AAAA,KAALA,KAAK;AA+IX,eAAeA,KAAK;AAAC;AAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
