  <blockquote>In January of 2014 I started volunteering at ARF. It was the greatest decision of my life!  I mentioned that if they ever got a tuxedo with a white-tipped tail, I would want him. Two weeks later, Piglet, now known as Roscoe, showed up. What a guy he turned out to be. He follows me all over the house, greets me at the door with a “meow” when I come home, and snuggles in bed sometimes. </blockquote>

  <blockquote>I had the most wonderful experience adopting a dog from ARF this summer. Biscuit is a year-old terrier mix and the absolute sweetest girl, and she came house-trained, too. Everyone who sees her loves her, and she has settled in perfectly to New York City life with weekends in the country. She loves my two cats, although it’s not entirely mutual! I can’t say enough about ARF. </blockquote>

  <blockquote>Thank you for the wonderful experience of adopting Daisy. She has been wonderful. She settled into our journey across the States like a pro, as if she were part of us from the very beginning. Just wanted to let you know that we are truly grateful for how well cared for she was and how much she will be loved here. Lots of hugs! At first, CeCe was a little bit nervous and shy. I knew that was normal !!</blockquote>
